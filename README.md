This document outlines a linear regression model that predicts exam scores based on the number of hours a student studied.

Purpose:

This model aims to:

Identify the relationship between study hours and exam performance.
Predict exam scores for future students based on their study time.
Help students optimize their study strategies by determining the most efficient ways to improve their results.
Data:

The model requires a dataset containing two variables for each student:

Study Hours: The number of hours a student spent studying for the exam.
Exam Score: The student's score on the exam.
Model Training:

The model will be trained using a standard linear regression algorithm. This algorithm will find the best-fitting line through the data points, representing the relationship between study hours and exam scores.

Model Output:

The model will output two key metrics:

Linear Equation: This equation represents the line of best fit and can be used to predict exam scores for new data points.
Coefficient of Determination (R-squared): This statistic indicates the strength of the relationship between study hours and exam scores. Higher R-squared values indicate a stronger correlation.
